Project Title : Studious-best online education provider

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:Accessibility: Online education provides access to education for people who might otherwise not have access, such as those who live in remote areas, have disabilities or health issues that prevent them from attending in-person classes, or have work or family obligations that make it difficult to attend classes on a regular schedule.
Flexibility: Online education allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be particularly helpful for those who need to balance their education with work or other commitments.
Affordability: Online education can be more affordable than traditional in-person education, as it eliminates the need for expenses such as transportation and housing. Additionally, online courses and programs often have lower tuition fees than their in-person counterparts.
